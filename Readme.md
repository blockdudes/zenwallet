# Zenrock Multi-Chain Wallet

Zenrock is a revolutionary multi-chain wallet designed to simplify the DeFi and cryptocurrency experience. With Zenrock, users can interact with their favorite dApps, manage assets, and receive funds across multiple blockchains without the need to manage multiple wallets or bridge assets.

## Problem

The cryptocurrency ecosystem is fragmented with hundreds of blockchains like Ethereum, Bitcoin, Polygon, and Solana, among others. This fragmentation requires users to install multiple wallets and continuously manage and bridge their assets across these chains. This complexity is a significant barrier to crypto adoption and a major pain point for users.

## Solution

Zenrock addresses these challenges by providing a unified platform where:
- **No Bridging Required:** Users no longer need to bridge assets between chains.
- **Chain Agnostic:** Users don't have to worry about the specific chain of a dApp.
- **Simplified Experience:** All interactions are handled in one place, making DeFi accessible to everyone.

## Use
```typescript
npm install
npm run dev
```

```typescript
// determinitic address 

usdc - 0x267EFC7CCbCEf743FdA8EB1a3Ec95656a4A4CF25
usdt - 0x21Dc74F18166F73d48978c3E3167F29c44a19328

```

Use deterministic address only for ERC20 transfers and Uniswap operations. The current Uniswap setup includes liquidity pools for USDC/USDT, which you can mint from the specified address above.

## Vision and Impact

Our goal is to build the futureâ€”a platform where managing multiple wallets and bridging assets is a thing of the past. By solving this key pain point, Zenrock aims to:
- Attract traders, investors, and DeFi enthusiasts who are looking for a simpler way to engage with multiple chains.
- Become the go-to wallet for newcomers in the cryptocurrency space.
- Facilitate billions of dollars in transactions, fostering a more accessible and user-friendly DeFi ecosystem.
